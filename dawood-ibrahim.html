            Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar
        </h3>
    
        <p>
            <b>Full Name :</b> Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar<br>
           <b> Date of Birth :</b> December 26, 1955<br>
           <b>Place of Birth :</b> Dongri, Mumbai, India<br>
            <b>Family :</b> Dawood's father, Ibrahim Kaskar, was a police constable.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1980s, Dawood formed his own gang, known as D-Company. <br>This organization quickly grew to dominate Mumbai's underworld, dealing <br>in extortion, smuggling, and drug trafficking.<br><br>
           <b>Key Associates :</b>  His close associates included Chhota Rajan and Abu Salem,<br> who played significant roles in his criminal enterpris.
           <br><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The rivalry was fueled by Manya Surve's growing influence and his attempts <br>to take over territories controlled by Dawood Ibrahim's D-Company and other <br>established gangs.<br><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict between Surve and Dawood escalated into a series of violent confrontations<br> and retaliations, with both sides suffering significant casualties.
           <br>The rivalry culminated in the encounter killing of Manya Surve by the Mumbai police <br>on January 11, 1982. This encounter was one of the first recorded "encounter killings" <br>in Mumbai, marking a significant shift in how the police dealt with organized <br>crime.
