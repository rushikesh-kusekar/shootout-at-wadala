        &nbsp;&nbsp;Manohar Arjun “Manya” Surve (8 August 1944 - 11 January 1982), was <br>an <u>Indian criminal and gangster based in Mumbai</u>. He was one of the <br>educated gangsters who graduated from college and was very well known for <br>challenging and defeating existing gangs.
       <br>
       <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Surve was known for his daredevilry and strategic planning. As<br> a young man and graduate of Kirti College, Surve was implicated in a<br> murder that he did not commit and was sentenced to imprisonment in Yerwada <br>Jail.[1] Within just two years of activity, his crew rose to such<br> prominence that the Pathans, who had ruled the underworld for over<br> two decades, sought his help in murdering the Konkani-speaking Kaskar brothers,<br> <u>Dawood and Shabbir</u>, the leaders of their archrival gang, D-Company.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;Following the murder of Shabir Ibrahim, Surve's fellow <br>accomplices began to fall off one by one. Noticing this,<br> Surve laid low. Meanwhile, local law enforcement was preparing<br> operations to reduce persistent mob violence with an onslaught of<br> targeted assassinations. Inspectors Isaque Bagwan and Raja Tambhat,<br> with Senior Inspector Y. D. Bhide, was put in charge of taking down<br> Surve. <u>Surve was killed in 1982 by the Maharashtra police</u> which is regarded <br>as Mumbai's first encounter killing.<br>
