            &nbsp;&nbsp; There is limited detailed information available about Vidya Joshi's biography.<br>
            Vidya Joshi's personal background, including her early life and activities after<br> Manya Surve's death, is not well-documented in available sources.<br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Vidya Joshi was the girlfriend of Manya Surve, a notorious gangster in Mumbai<br> during the late 1970s and early 1980s. She played a pivotal role in his eventual capture.<br> The police used her as a conduit to trap Surve. On January 11, 1982, Manya Surve went<br> to pick up Vidya from a salon near Ambedkar College in Wadala. The police, having learned <br>of his whereabouts, laid a trap and shot him in an encounter, which became the first recorded<br> police encounter killing in India.
